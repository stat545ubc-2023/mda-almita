# Mini Data Analysis

*by Alma Garcia*

## What is this about?

This repository contains my "Mini Data Analysis" project from the STAT545 class. The analysis is focused on the `steam_games` data set from Kaggle as well as the `steam.csv` dataset (found in the `data` folder and explained in `mini-project-2.Rmd`). Here I apply what I've learned of the *tidyverse* during the STAT-545A class. If you'd like to explore the project, you can clone the repo (or download it from releases) and run the R-markdown files in R Studio to see my code, comments and plots :blush:. You can also open the markdown file and see the knitted output. Or you can also look at the plots in the `mini-project-1_files` or `mini-project-2_files` folders. 

## What files are in the project?

-   **README.md**: self explanatory
-   **mini-project-1.Rmd**: runnable R-Markdown file for the first project milestone
-   **mini-project-1.md**: markdown file for the first project milestone (knitted from .Rmd)
-   **mini-project1_files**: folder containing the first project milestone plots
-   **mini-project-2.Rmd**: runnable R-Markdown file for the second project milestone
-   **mini-project-2.md**: markdown file for the second project milestone (knitted from .Rmd)
-   **mini-project1_files**: folder containing the second project milestone plots
-   **output**: folder containing the files from Task 4 in `mini-project-2.Rmd`
