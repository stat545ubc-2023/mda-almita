# Mini Data Analysis
_by Alma Garcia_  

## What is this about?
This repository contains my "Mini Data Analysis" project from the STAT545 class. The analysis is focused on the `steam_games` data set from Kaggle and applying what I've learned of the _tidyverse_ during class. If you'd like to explore the project, you can clone the repo (or download it from releases) and run the `mini-project-1.Rmd` file in R Studio to see my code, comments and plots :blush:. You can also open the `mini-project-1.md` file and see the knitted output. Or you can also look at the plot in the `mini-project-1_files`

##What files are in the project?

- **README.md**: self explanatory
- **mini-project-1.Rmd**: runnable R-Markdown file for the first project milestone
- **mini-project-1.md**: knitted output for the first project milestone
- **mini-project1_files**: folder containing the first project milestone plots
