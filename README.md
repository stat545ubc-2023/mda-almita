# Mini Data Analysis
_by Alma Garcia_  

This repository contains my "Mini Data Analysis" project from the STAT545 class. The analysis is focused on the `steam_games` data set from Kaggle and applying what I've learned of the _tidyverse_ during class. If you'd like to explore the project, you can clone the repo (or download it from releases) and run the mini-project-1.Rmd file in R Studio to see my code, comments and plots :blush:
